# The Perceptron
This project implements a simple homebrew perceptron implemented in Python.

## Canned Problem Set
Since the convergence of the perceptron is only guaranteed if the two classes are linearly seperable and the learning rate is sufficiently small, we create a canned dataset that is guaranteed to converge.
